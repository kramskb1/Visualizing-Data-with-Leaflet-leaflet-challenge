	An earthquake data set was visualized. The USGS GeoJSON Feed Page was visited. I picked the data set “All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days” to visualize. I was given a JSON representation of that data. I used the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for my visualization. 
	A map was created using Leaflet that plotted all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appeared larger. Earthquakes with greater depth appeared darker in color. The depth of the earth was found as the third coordinate of each earthquake. 
	Popups were included that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. A legend was created that provides context for the map data. I referred to leaflet documentation on how to create a legend. I included all css necessary for styling. I made sure that my map looked similar to the one given in the instructions.
