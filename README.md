	An earthquake data set was visualized. The USGS GeoJSON Feed Page was visited. I picked the data set “All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days” to visualize. I was given a JSON representation of that data. I used the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for my visualization. 
	A map was created using Leaflet that plotted all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appeared larger. Earthquakes with greater depth appeared darker in color. The depth of the earth was found as the third coordinate of each earthquake.
